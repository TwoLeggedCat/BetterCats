# BetterCats

Paper plugin to make Minecraft cats better.

## What does it do?

This plugin presently does two things:

1. Cats make noises when you right-click them. Being the original purpose for this plugin, this is all I could come up with when someone asked me "How do I pet cats?"
2. Cats play with string left as items on the ground.

## Where to download?

The [releases section](https://github.com/TwoLeggedCat/BetterCats/releases/) on the right side (recommended), or, if you have a GitHub account, the "Actions" tab at the top (these builds may not be intended as releases).

## Does it run on Spigot?

No, as Spigot lacks Paper's mob goal API, and I have no reason to go out of the reaches of the API just to support it. If, for some reason, you want to use it on Spigot, you can simply delete all the code relevant to playing with string and be left with cats that make noises.

## Disclaimer

I do not expect a single living being other than myself to install this plugin. It's public only because "why not?". That doesn't mean you can't, and I'll be happy to try and fix any issues you may have, but don't expect any code I put here to be perfect (you can always tell me ways to improve it, though!).
